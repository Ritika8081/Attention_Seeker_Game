### Game Objective
Control a spaceship using your focus (EEG) and hand movements (EMG) to navigate through space and destroy obstacles.

### Hardware used
We have used *Neuro Play Ground (NPG) Lite* which is a  multichannel wireless bio-potential signal amplification device designed for recording *EMG, ECG, EOG, and EEG*. It comes in a compact Adafruit feather form factor and offers WiFi/BLE wireless connectivity. With the addition of daughter boards called Playmates, users can easily enhance the deviceâ€™s capabilities, enabling the students/researchers/hobbyists to create awesome Human-Computer Interface (HCI) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications.
